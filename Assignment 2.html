                Pollution is the introduction of <span> contaminants </span> into the natural environment that cause
                adverse change.[1]
                Pollution can take the form of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as radioactivity,
                heat, sound, or light). <span> Pollutants</span>, the components of pollution, can be either foreign
                substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although environmental pollution can be caused by natural events, the word pollution generally implies
                that the contaminants <span> have an anthropogenic source</span> that is, a source created by human
                activities, such
                as <span>x manufacturing, extractive industries</span>, poor waste management, transportation or
                agriculture. Pollution
                is often classed as point source (coming from a highly concentrated specific site, such as a factory,
                mine, construction site), or nonpoint source pollution (coming from a widespread distributed sources,
                such as <span> microplastics</span> or <span>agricultural runoff).

                A man is an <span> adult male human.[a][2][3]</span> Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as
                a <span> boy</span> (a male <span> child</span> or <span> adolescent</span>).
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                Like most other male <span> mammals</span>, a man's <span> genome</span> usually inherits an <span> X
                    chromosome</span> from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father. Sex differentiation of the
                male fetus is governed by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. During puberty, hormones which stimulate
                androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics that result in even
                more differences between the sexes. These include greater muscle mass, greater height, the growth of
                <span> facial hair and a lower body fat</span> composition. Male anatomy is distinguished from female
                anatomy by the male reproductive system, which includes the penis, scrotum, testicles, sperm duct,
                prostate gland and epididymis, and by <span> secondary sex characteristics</span>, including a narrower
                pelvis and hips, and smaller breasts and nipples.
